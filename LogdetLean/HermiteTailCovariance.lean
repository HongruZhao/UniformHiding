# The algebraic fourth-chaos consequence of Mehler's identity

The source is Zhao, *On the Log Determinant of Sample Correlation Matrices
under Gaussianity*, arXiv:2608.00565v1, Lemma 5.2, printed p. 11, together
with the proof in the manuscript subsection “Direct computation of the
second chaos projection” and Appendix “The Hermite covariance identity.”
The one-dimensional identity credited there is Nourdin--Peccati (2012),
Proposition 2.2.1, p. 26; the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck/Mehler formulation is their
Definition 2.8.1 and Theorem 2.8.2, pp. 45--47.

This module proves the infinite-series inequality used after Mehler's
identity.  A `FourthChaosEnergy` records the nonnegative squared L2 norms of
the even chaos components of degrees `4,6,8,...`.  It does **not** claim that
a given random variable has such a profile; that analytic Hermite-expansion
bridge remains a separate theorem obligation.
