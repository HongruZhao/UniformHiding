# The signed first-order Edgeworth CDF comparator

The first Edgeworth approximation is generally a signed approximation rather
than the CDF of a probability measure.  We therefore represent it as a real
function and prove its exact uniform distance from the Gaussian CDF.  This
avoids silently asserting positivity or monotonicity that need not hold.
