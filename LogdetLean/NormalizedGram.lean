# Normalized Gram matrices

This file formalizes the deterministic first part of Rouault's Uniform Gram
construction.  A sample correlation matrix under the null is the Gram matrix
of independently normalized Gaussian columns.  Before probability enters, its
determinant is exactly the determinant of the unnormalized Gram matrix divided
by the product of the squared column norms.

The convention `0⁻¹ = 0` makes the identities valid even for a zero column.
Gaussian columns are nonzero almost surely; that probabilistic fact is proved
separately in the bridge development.

Mathematical provenance: Rouault (2005), Section 2.1, equations (8)--(10),
printed pp. 4--5, and Rouault (2007), equations (2.4)--(2.7), printed
pp. 185--186.  See `PROVENANCE.md` for complete bibliographic data and the
notation map.  The identities are reproved here; no published theorem is
imported as an axiom.
