# Squared norms of iid circular Gaussians and the Gamma convention

Mathlib's real standard-Gaussian norm theorem uses rate `1/2`.  The circular
normalization divides every real coordinate by `sqrt 2`; consequently its
squared norm is one half of that Gamma variable.  This module records that
normalization exactly, before any optional identification of the pushforward
with a rate-one Gamma density.
